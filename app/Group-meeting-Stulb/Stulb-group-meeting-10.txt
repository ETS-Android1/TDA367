-peer review should see something it is unclear, small details that are easy to fix. Do you understand the stuff
it is clear and easy to understand.

-Write down where small detail implementations are needed / should be so you get an overview and know where they should be in the end when you implement it.

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)


- TODO next week, Peer review, Calendar, search function & filtering, detail view of car, start with JJ-Unit tests (balance out so everyone gets enough commits / lines of code).
