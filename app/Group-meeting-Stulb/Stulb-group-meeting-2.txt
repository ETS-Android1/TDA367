- Tell our counsellor Leo and the rest of the group about our idea for the project. (airBnb for cars).
- Leo says the idea seems nice and possible and would not be over ambitious and to hard to do.
- Recommendation to start with a mock-application and to start making it easy and later on do extensions as the app is somewhat functional. Focus on the big picture first.
- User stories, Leo says it will be more clear what we will do and what it is as we will have more lectures.
- Good to have a clear UML to begin with it makes it easier to work.
